# Pet-projects

## The first pet-project is a **price parser**.

### How does it work?
You add bot *@YetAnotherPriceCheckerBot* in Telegram, upload links to the goods, from which you want to parse prices and request an update when need it.

TODO:
- users welcoming
- parsing from ozon/yandex/etc
- rethink functional necessity
